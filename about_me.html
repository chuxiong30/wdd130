        <h1>About me</h1>
            <h2>Chu Xiong</h2>
            <h2>Hello, hello, my name is Chu Xiong. Some common nickname that I also go by include;
                Chu Chu, Chewie, Hi-Chew(like the candy,) Pikachu, and Chewbacca. I have a few others, but these are the more common ones.
                Feel free to call me any of those if you'd like!
                On the other hand, if you think of a nickname for me, I'd love to know what it is!
</h2>
            <p>My name is Chu Xiong, I am Hmong and we don't have a country. 
                Hmong is my native language, but my English is better than my Hmong. 
                I am a freshman here at BYU-Idaho. This is my second semester and 
                I'm majoring in software engineering. Some important things that you 
                need to know about me are that I love cats, but ironically enough, 
                I am allergic to them. I also love playing volleyball, snow-tubing, water-tubing, going hiking, watching anime, and snowboarding.
                Winter is my favorite season, because of all the things I can do. 
                I've also been told that I have a RBF and that I'm difficult to approach, but once you get to know
                me more, I'm actually quite "wild," outgoing, weird (the funny kind of weird,) and a total crackhead.
                I also need more friends so please be friends with me! </p>
